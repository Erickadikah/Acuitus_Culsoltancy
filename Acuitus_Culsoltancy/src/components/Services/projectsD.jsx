            We also provided financial and market linkages to these groups, thus
            promoting access to capital, which is essential for their growth and
            operations.
            Farmers were also linked to input providers to acquire
            quality seeds, fertilizers, and farm machinery, among other essentials.

            Associations (VSLAs)

          <p class="text-white">
            The study targeted VSLA groups in 10 Kenyan counties and compared
            VSLAs that received value-added training with those that were solely
            trained on traditional VSLA methods. It explored various dimensions
            including financial literacy, savings behavior, Business Development
            Services (BDS) utilization, Income Generating Activities (IGA), loan
            management, and entrepreneurship engagement. Key findings
            highlighted the positive impact of value-added training on financial
            literacy, diversified investment behavior, BDS usage, IGA
            development, loan management practices, entrepreneurship engagement,
            and empowerment.

            The assessment comprehensively examined several key aspects within
            the VSLAs. The approach involved examining multiple key aspects
            within the VSLAs (Village Savings and Loan Associations) to gather
            information and identify their needs and requirements. The variable
            include their level of income, knowledge of financial management,
            availability of linkages, factors affecting their agribusiness
            activities, sources of income, value chain involvement, and
            identified support requirements.
